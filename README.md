# Pixel Art Maker Project

## How It works

You can create simple art by creating a grid and adding color to it. You select the particular height and width you want and the color you want to fill the cells then submit. Clicking on each cell adds color to the cell.

## What I did

* I created a simple art maker using JS.
* I was able to access users input to manipulate the DOM, trigger grid creation and modify colors.
